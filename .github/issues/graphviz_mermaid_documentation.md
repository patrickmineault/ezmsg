# Document Graphviz and Mermaid features

## Description
Currently the documentation does not describe how to generate Graphviz or Mermaid diagrams of a pipeline. The `ezmsg` command-line interface includes `graphviz` and `mermaid` commands, but the docs do not mention them.

## Tasks
- [ ] Add a section to the docs explaining how to use the `ezmsg graphviz` and `ezmsg mermaid` commands.
- [ ] Document the optional `--target` parameter for mermaid output.
- [ ] Provide basic examples demonstrating how to generate and view diagrams.
